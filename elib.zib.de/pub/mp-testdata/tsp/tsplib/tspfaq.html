<H1>TSPLIB: Questions and answers</H1>
<BR>
<HR>
Q: I found a better solution than the one claimed to be optimal in TSPLIB,
is this possible?
<BR><BR>
A: This never occured so far. In 
all cases when someone believed to have found a better solution, it
was not taken into account that it is exactly specified how distances
for TSPLIB problems have to computed. Typical errors are 
<UL><LI>
evaluation of
distances for geometric problem instances as floating-point numbers,
<BR><LI>
false computation of geographic distances,
<BR><LI>
use of display coordinates for distance computations.
<BR>
</UL>
Note, however, that due to round-off errors distance evaluations may slightly differ on different machines.
<HR>
Q: I get wrong distances for problems of type GEO.
<BR><BR>
A: In a previous release there was a typing error in the distance
specification for these problems. The formulae for computing latitude[i]
and longitude[i] should read
<UL>
latitude[i] = PI * (deg + 5.0 * min / 3.0 ) / 180.0;
<BR>
longitude[i] = PI * (deg + 5.0 * min / 3.0 ) / 180.0;
</UL>
<HR>
Q: What does the function nint() do?
<BR><BR>
A: The function "int nint (double x)"
converts x into int format rounding  to  the  nearest
int value, except halfway cases are rounded to the int value
larger in magnitude.  This corresponds to the  Fortran  generic 
intrinsic function nint. 
<HR>
Q: Are contributions still welcome?
<BR><BR>
A: Basically yes, but, in view of the many problem instances that are
already available, new instances should either be real challenge
problems or be of general interest.
<HR>
Q: Is an optimal tour available for every solved problem instance?
<BR><BR>
A: No. We have included several optimal tours for testing purposes. It is
not intended to provide all optimal tours. It should still be a
challenge to find one.
<HR>
Q: Are there optimal solutions available for instances other than symmetric
ones?
<BR><BR>
A: So far, no other optimal solutions have been made available.
<HR>
Q: Which format has been used to store the data?
<BR><BR>
A: All data has been compressed with the command "gzip" and has to be
read using "gzip -d". Please contact your system administrator
if this command is not available.
<HR>
<BR>
<H1>Some remarks</H1>
<BR>
Problem a280 contains a double node, so there are essentially only 279 nodes.
We have not changed the problem name, though.
